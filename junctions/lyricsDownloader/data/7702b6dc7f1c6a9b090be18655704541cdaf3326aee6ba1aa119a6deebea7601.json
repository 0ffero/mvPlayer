(You've had a few)\n'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)\nBusy being yours to fall for somebody new (being yours)\nNow I've thought it through\n\nCrawlin' back to you (do I wanna know?)\nIf this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made for sayin' things\nThat you can't say tomorrow day\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nToo busy bein' yours to fall\n(Sad to see you go)\nEver thought of callin', darlin'?\n(Do I wanna know?)\nDo you want me crawlin' back to you?",
